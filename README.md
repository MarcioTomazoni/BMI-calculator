This project belongs to "The Complete Android 13 App Development Bootcamp" course, which was created by Mr. Vin Norman and acquired by me through Udemy. [Watch on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-android-developer-bootcamp/)

My only intention with publishing the project is to learn how to use the tools: Git, GitHub, as well as the tools used during the course, which by the way is great. I recommend it.

The project creates an app that calculates the Body Mass Index. The app must be installed on a mobile device using Android OS.

The project is developed in java. I'm currently using the API:
